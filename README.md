# sgRNA_BbsI_oligo_conversion
Plasmid-based expression of Cas9 (and variants) with single guide RNA (sgRNA) often entails annealing of an sgRNA duplex into plasmid BbsI sites.  This shell script automates creation of upper and lower ('fwd' and 'rev') oligos compatible with BbsI cloning, when provided simply with a text file listing sgRNA name(s) and 5'-3' nucleotide sequence(s).
